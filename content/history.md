# Milestones

## 2001

* June 30: the Mono project is announced.
* Aug 21: a remote compilation service is setup so that people who are contributing to Mono can submit their code over a web page and compile the code with the Microsoft C# compiler.
* Aug 28: the Mono runtime runs "Hello World" for the first time. Hello World consists of 1821 CIL instructions, performs 66 subroutine calls and loads 12 classes from the corlib.dll
* Sep 4: the monoburg tree pattern matching instruction selector is checked into CVS, this is the beginning of the Mono native code generator engine.
* Sep 5: Mono's C# compiler which is written in C# compiles its first program: "Hello world" on Windows using the .NET runtime.  The resulting executable runs on Linux as well with the runtime from August 28th.
* Sep 10: Dietmar Maurer checks the x86 code generation rules for monoburg.
* Sep 17: the first version of Gtk# is checked into Mono's CVS repository.
* Sep 18: Mono 0.7 is released (<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.7" class="external text" rel="nofollow">release notes</a>).
* Sep 21: Dick Porter gets the initial thread support into Mono's interpreter; Paolo Molaro implemented many new opcodes; Dietmar Maurer got long operations and mul/div working on the JIT engine; Ravi rewrote the Method selector for expressions to be conformant; Miguel gets i++ working in the compiler.
* Sep 26: A build system based on Ant is contributed by Sergey and Sean.  We will be maintaining a dual build system based on Makefiles and Ant for quite some time.
* Oct 4th: The reflection support is complete enough to generate a sample program.
* Oct 5th: Sergey publishes his IL assembler.
* Nov 4th: Mike posts an [update on Gtk#](http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2001-November/000017.html)
* Nov 14th: Paolo Molaro checks in the code that makes the C# compiler run and compile "Hello world" on Linux for the first time.
* Nov 30th: Dietmar gets the JIT in good shape: All the tests that we had with the Mono interpreter now pass and execute with the Mono JIT engine.
* Dec 11st: the JIT engine is able to host the Mono C# compiler and run all of its regression tests. 
* Dec 28th: The Mono C# compiler compiles itself, but the code generated is not correct yet.

## 2002

* Jan 3: Mono's C# compiler can bootstrap itself using the .NET runtime.  The next stage is to get it bootstrapping with the Mono runtime.
* Jan 4: Mono gains Unicode support.
* Jan 21: Dick posts a screenshot of a simple web server running on Mono: [here](http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/dick-mis-server.png).  This web server is used to test and exercise our IO layer.
* Jan 23: the mono-patches mailing list debuts.  Each patch is mailed to people in this mailing list.  The era of asynchronous reviews begins.
* Jan 28: Mono class libraries are relicensed from the LGPL to the [MIT X11](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html) license. 
* Jan 29: Dan Lewis contributes System.Text.RegularExpressions.
* Feb 11: Initial ports of the Mono interpreter to SPARC and PowerPC.
* Feb 13: Dietmar checks-in the code to support AppDomains, Nick Drochak has lead the group to use NUnit for testing the current implementation of our class libraries.
* Feb 22: Mono 0.9 is [released](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.9).
* Feb 25: Sergey's StrongARM port of Mono's interpreter is checked in.
* Mar 7: First time the Mono's C# compiler compiles on Linux.
* Mar 12: Paolo managed to make Mono's C# compiler self-hosting on Linux.
* June 25: Piers Haken contributes the initial XPath implementation to Mono and Dick Porter contributes the Process class and its related infrastructure to Mono.
* June 30: The Mono C# compiler is able to build mscorlib, the last piece to achieve self-hosting of the Mono runtime.

## 2004

* June 30th: Mono 1.0 is released.
